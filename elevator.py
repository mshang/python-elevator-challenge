    An incorrect implementation. Can you make it pass all the tests?

    Fix the methods below to implement the correct logic for elevators.

    $ python -m doctest -v README.md

    To learn when each method is called, read its docstring.
    To interact with the world, you can get the current floor from the
    `current_floor` property of the `callbacks` object, and you can move the
